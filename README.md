This is my .bash_Profile

The scripts set my prompt to the current directory. That directory is red if you have uncommitted changes, or green if you have committed.

This is followed by the branch name if in a git monitored directory. It will be red for production, yellow for master, and blue if on a safe branch.

I have also changed my prompt to "Feed Me: " much to the annoyance of many of my mentors.

These files include some helpful aliases.
